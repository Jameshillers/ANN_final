# ANN_final
This project is aimed at using journaling data to predict emotions from entries. \n

Files Contained in the Repo
data_cleaning.ipynb: 
    File containing all of the data transformations and cleaning that we had to do on
    both the original dataset and the dataset we collected from students in our class
data_cleaning_import.py: 
    This is the same file as above except as a .py file for easier importing
data.csv: 
    csv file of the Lemotif dataset
student_data.csv:
    csv file of the student journal entries and emotions/activities
model.ipynb:
    This is our initial logistic regression model
distilbert_model.ipynb:
    This is our distilbert models that have different attributes added to them
topic_emotion_correlation.ipynb
    File contaiend topic and emotion correlation analysis to see ow the themes from the journals
    line up with the activities being done in the journal entries
best_model.pt & emotion_classification_model_complete.pt
    Saved models so we don't need to run code again
daily_notes.txt
    daily journal of results and things we have done to keep track and then compile our results. 
final_visualization.R:
    R code to create visualizations to present on
distil_bert_emotion.ipynb:
    Distil BERT model that was trained only to predict emotions
bert_model & bert_model2:
    These contains the models that used just the BERT based model
