# ANN_final
This project is aimed at using journaling data to predict emotions from entries. 

Files contained in this repository:
data_cleaning: cleaning the data and making it usable for training neural networks
logistic_regression: creating simple models that are at least functional but likely not accurate
NLP_modeling: higher accuracy models with greater complexity


About the data:
We will be using this dataset from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhavmalhotra/journal-entries-with-labelled-emotions?resource=download 

The data was collected for the study 
"Lemotif: An Affective Visual Journal Using Deep Neural Networks" by X. Li and Devi Parikh. The journal entries were collected by asking the users two questions:
What were salient aspects of your day yesterday? 
How did you feel about them?
They then were asked to label which emotions are present in the journal entry so they could test if they could identify emotions.
